		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a driven and dedicated student named Stiven Gjekaj, with a strong passion for technology and innovation.
            Recently, I completed an ICT project where I designed and created a website that showcased my technical skills and creativity.
            As a student, I am known for my hardworking and determined attitude.
            I have a keen eye for detail and I am meticulous in my work, ensuring that every aspect of my project is thoroughly researched,
            planned and executed to the best of my abilities. Creating the website for my ICT project was a rewarding experience that allowed
            me to put my technical and creative skills to the test. I am proud of the end result and excited to see
            where my passion for technology will take me in the future.
